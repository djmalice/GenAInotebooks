# GenAI Notebooks Collection

Welcome to the **GenAI Notebooks Collection**! 🚀 This repository contains a curated set of Jupyter notebooks covering various Generative AI (GenAI) techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, multi-agent frameworks, text splitters, and more.

## 📌 Contents

### 1️⃣ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Implementing RAG
- Optimizing retrieval for better generation quality
- Hybrid search techniques (BM25 + embeddings)

### 2️⃣ Fine-Tuning
- Fine-tuning transformer models for domain-specific applications
- LoRA and QLoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Evaluating fine-tuned models

### 3️⃣ Multi-Agent Frameworks
- Implementing AI agents that collaborate for complex tasks
- LangChain and AutoGPT-based multi-agent systems
- Case studies on multi-agent orchestration

### 4️⃣ Text Processing & Splitting
- Effective document chunking for better embedding performance
- Custom text splitters for structured and unstructured data
